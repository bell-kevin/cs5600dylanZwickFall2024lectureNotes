        "\n",
        "One reason for this is the size of the data for each observation. For the hand-written digits, we had a $28 \\times 28$ grid, and each grid had a greyscale score between 0 and 255, which meant 784 inputs per observation. That's not a trivial number, but it's much smaller than the amount of data in a standard digital image. For a standard digital image something like a $200 \\times 200$ grid is much more common, and instead of there being a single greyscale value, there are typically 3 (RGB) color values, which would mean each observation would have about $200 \\times 200 \\times 3 = 120,000$ data points. That's a lot of data, and consequently a lot of weights to learn! With that many weights, convergence can be slow, and you need *a lot* of data if you want to avoid overfitting.\n",

If we only had three Conv2D layers then the $3 \\times 3$ windows in the third layer would only contain information coming from $7 \\times 7$ windows in the initial input. The high-level patterns learned will still be very small with regard to the initial input, which may not be enough to learn what we need to learn. So, why not just put in enough convolution layers to fully shrink down our image? Well, that leads to our second point.\n",

Unless you have a lot of data, that's way too many parameters, and you'll get intense overfitting. So, those pooling layers help decrease the overall size of your model, which makes it faster to train and more robust (less prone to overfitting). Please note that if we added a bunch more convolution layers, we'd have a ridiculously large number of parameters - much more than every pixel in our training data."
